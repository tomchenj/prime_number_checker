This is a STUPID prime number checker based on a magic regular expression.
The magic regular expression is '^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$'.
Try this script and try to understand the regular expression.
Make sure that you have 'colorama' package, you can run 'pip install colorama' to install it.(it's not neccesary at all, but I prefer pretty colourfull output.)
